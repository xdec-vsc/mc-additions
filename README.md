# MC Additions (Current Main Version: Version 1.0 - 1.16.5)

This is **Minecraft Additions**, a minecraft mod that adds stuff (which imo should have already been added).

  This current version (1.0) adds:

  The stonecutter to make wooden items

   This version adds a couple more things but since my computer can't record (without going down to 2 fps) so here they are. Scroll to below the image for the names.

  ![the rest](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/5408c38240357b34607ecdada7cf044a83fb852d.png)

  on the left/first column is the **Potion of Dolphin's Grace**, brewed with a Heart of the Sea

  on the right/second column is the **Potion of Wither**, brewed with **Witherpowder**, made by putting a wither rose into a furnace, which can be farmed or traded with a master level cleric.
